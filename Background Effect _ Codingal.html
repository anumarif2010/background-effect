Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.</p><p>                    &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>                &lt;/article&gt;</p><p>                &lt;aside&gt;&lt;!---Extra information related to article--&gt;</p><p>                    &lt;p&gt;</p><p>                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.

Go to the official website: [<a class="text-orange underline" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>](<a class="text-orange underline" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>)</p><p>2. Click **Download for Windows**.</p><p>3. Run the downloaded `.exe` installer.</p><p>4. During installation:</p><p></p><p>   * Check **"Add to PATH"** (important).</p><p>   * Optionally check **"Register Code as an editor for supported file types"**.</p><p>   * Complete the installation.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>### ✅ Step 2: Install Python</p><p></p><p>1. Visit [<a class="text-orange underline" href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.python.org/downloads</a>](<a class="text-orange underline" href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.python.org/downloads</a>).</p><p>2. Download the latest **Python for Windows**.</p><p>3. Run the installer and make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking "Install Now".</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>### ✅ Step 3: Install Python Extension in VS Code</p><p></p><p>1. Open **VS Code**.</p><p>2. Go to the **Extensions** tab (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).</p><p>3. Search for **Python** and install the one by **Microsoft**.</p><p>4. Restart VS Code if needed.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>### ✅ Step 4: Test Python Setup</p><p></p><p>1. Open a new folder or create a `.py` file.</p><p>2. Add a simple script like:</p><p></p><p>   ```python</p><p>   print("Hello, Python in VS Code!")</p><p>   ```</p><p>3. Right-click and select **Run Python File in Terminal**.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Would you like a one-click installer that sets up both Python and VS Code with all the tools preconfigured (via Python's official installer bundle)?</p></div><div class="w-5/6 ml-6"><span class="text-xs mx-1"></span><span class="text-grey-800">.</span><span class="text-grey-800 text-xs mx-1">May 12, 09:03 PM</span></div></div></div></div></div><form class="border-t border-grey-500 flex justify-between items-center py-5 px-3 space-x-5"><div class="relative flex-1"><textarea class=" py-1 border-b-2 border-orange-400 text-sm placeholder-grey-800 tracking-wider focus:outline-none w-full" placeholder="Send a message" style="height: 31px !important;"></textarea><p class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 -mb-4 text-xs text-grey-800 hidden md:block">Press Shift + Enter for new line</p></div><button class="bg-orange px-1 py-1 text-white text-sm rounded flex items-center justify-center focus:outline-none hover:bg-orange-500"><span class="px-1">Send</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="text-white"><line x1="22" y1="2" x2="11" y2="13"></line><polygon points="22 2 15 22 11 13 2 9 22 2"></polygon></svg></button></form></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"translation":{"'Scratch game development":"'Scratch game development","1 member":"1 member","1-on-1 sessions with all-star computer science teachers who are trained to be the perfect mentors on your coding journey":"1-on-1 sessions with all-star computer science teachers who are trained to be the perfect mentors on your coding journey","10+ coding languages":"10+ coding languages","1000+ classes booked in last 24 hours":"1000+ classes booked in last 24 hours","1000+ slots booked in last 24 hours":"1000+ slots booked in last 24 hours","12 months":"12 months","12-18 months":"12-18 months","12th Pass":"12th Pass","150,000+":"150,000+","18 months":"18 months","1st Option":"1st Option","2-4 months":"2-4 months","20% off":"20% off","20+":"20+","250,000+":"250,000+","2nd Option":"2nd Option","3 flexible plans to suit your \u003c0\u003echild’s learning style \u0026 schedule\u003c/0\u003e":"3 flexible plans to suit your \u003c0\u003echild’s learning style \u0026 schedule\u003c/0\u003e","3 months":"3 months","30+":"30+","350,000+":"350,000+","4-6 months":"4-6 months","4.7 rating by 162 reviews on Trustpilot":"4.7 rating by 162 reviews on Trustpilot","4.8 / 5 stars | \u003c0\u003eRead reviews\u003c/0\u003e":"4.8 / 5 stars | \u003c0\u003eRead reviews\u003c/0\u003e","45 minutes":"45 minutes","500+ slots booked in last 24 hours":"500+ slots booked in last 24 hours","500+ students have taken a free coding class in last 24 hours!

While home tuitions often concentrate merely on these areas, repeating what students learn at school, we aim to deepen and expand their mathematical understanding. Our curriculum is meticulously structured and delivered through online worksheets and interactive simulations, ensuring students not only understand but excel in math fundamentals. Our instructors are carefully selected and undergo comprehensive training to maintain the highest teaching standards. Unlike traditional home tuitions, which may have an unrestricted number of students, a Codingal class maintains a small group setting with no more than 7 to 8 students from various grades. This approach minimizes competition, fostering a more supportive learning environment, and allows our teachers to provide personalized attention to each student, ensuring individual growth and understanding.":"At Codingal, we believe that effective learning extends beyond homework completion and exam preparation.

It’s common for students to achieve scores of 95% to 100% yet lack a solid grasp of fundamental math concepts. This often leads to difficulties in higher grades as the subject matter becomes more complex. At Codingal, we provide personalized attention to identify and strengthen areas where each student needs improvement. For those who already excel in the basics, our program advances into more complex areas, including preparation for math Olympiads and increasing challenge levels to keep engagement high. Moreover, to prevent boredom and maintain interest for students who might not feel sufficiently challenged by their school curriculum, Codingal offers a variety of stimulating activities like tab-based exercises and interactive puzzles.":"At Codingal, we recognize that scoring high in school exams doesn’t necessarily reflect a child’s true understanding of math.
